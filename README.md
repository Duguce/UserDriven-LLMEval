Towards Comprehensive Evaluation of Open-Source Language Models: A Multi-Dimensional, User-Driven Approach
</h2></div>

This project implements a multi-dimensional evaluation framework for open-source models, primarily focusing on Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework uses key metrics such as User Engagement Index (UEI), Community Response Rate (CRR), and Time Weight Factor (TWF) to provide a holistic view of model performance based on real-world usage and community support. The system also employs Bayesian optimization for dynamic adjustment of metric weights, ensuring a balanced and fair evaluation of models.

### Project Vision

As the number of open-source models increases, especially in the fields of natural language processing and computer vision, selecting the right model for a specific task can become overwhelming. This project aims to help developers and researchers quickly identify and evaluate widely recognized and popular open-source models, based not only on technical metrics but also on user feedback and community engagement. This approach ensures that models are not just evaluated on accuracy but on how well they resonate with the broader community.

### Future Outlook

Iâ€™m not entirely sure if this initiative is meaningful or if it will gain attention or recognition. If it does, I will consider adding more models and providing real-time updates to the metrics. Furthermore, the scope of this project can be expanded beyond language models to include other fields, such as vision models or comprehensive benchmarking systems. This would help researchers quickly identify and select models that are widely recognized and used across various domains.
